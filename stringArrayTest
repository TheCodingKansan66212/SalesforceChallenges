//written in Apex, 16 July 2020
//challenge was to create an Apex class with a method that returns an array of strings.
//generateStringArray method had to accept an incoming Integer as a parameter, which would determine the number of returned strings.
//the method must return a string value in the format Test n where n is the index of the current string in the array.
